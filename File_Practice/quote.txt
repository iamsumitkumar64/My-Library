When your days are cold, and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
